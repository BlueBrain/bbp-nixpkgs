        Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of C++11 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind.
        Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. 
        In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.
